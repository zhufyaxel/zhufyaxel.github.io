Hello! I'm Fengyuan Zhu, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, focusing on spatial computing. I'm working with Prof. <a href="https://www.tovigrossman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tovi Grossman</a> at the <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic Graphics Project Lab</a>.

My doctoral research is motivated by a vision to transcend traditional 2D screen interactions and delve into the realm of three-dimensional space. This journey is twofold: firstly, I am exploring the integration of smart devices with VR and AR to enrich digital experiences. Secondly, I am focused on enhancing input precision in VR and AR environments to facilitate more natural and intuitive interactions.

The emergence of Large Models has recently shifted part of my research, and I am excited about the potential of combining sensory perception and content generation in three-dimensional spaces with LMs. Some of my works in this exciting new field will soon be published on arXiv and shared with you, so keep an eye out!

Before this, at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), I led the <a href="https://1.holokit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holokit</a> open-source project, achieving significant impact.

I hold a Bachelor's in Physics from Peking University with a minor in Art, a background that drives my approach to human-computer interaction and creative projects.
