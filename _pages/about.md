Hello! I'm Fengyuan Zhu, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, focusing on spatial computing. I'm working with Prof. <a href="https://www.tovigrossman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tovi Grossman</a> at the <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic Graphics Project Lab</a>.

My doctoral research is driven by a vision to integrate existing digital ecosystems into spatial environment, with a focus on bridging smart devices with VR/AR. The rapid emergence of Large Language Models has introduced new possibilities for automating these integrations, significantly influencing the direction of my work.

Before this, at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), I led the <a href="https://1.holokit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holokit</a> open-source project, achieving significant impact.

I hold a Bachelor's in Physics from Peking University with a minor in Art, a background that drives my approach to human-computer interaction and creative projects.
